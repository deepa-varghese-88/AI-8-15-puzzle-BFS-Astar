# AI-8-15-puzzle-BFS-Astar
the 8 and 15 puzzle using BFS and A* algorithms in Python

How to run the code:

1) Open the code in python
2) at the bottom, check the section commented as # ---- 8 puzzle-----
3) Followed by the inputs used for the assessment, all commented
4) Uncomment any input, or write a new one similar to the ones commented
5) these are shortly followed by three lines
#heuristic = "manhattanDistance"
#heuristic = "euclideanDistance"
heuristic = "misplacedTiles"
To use any one of these heuristics, uncomment it, ensure the others remain commented or the value might get overriden
6) run the code
7) Similarly for 15 puzzle, comment the inputs and output under # ---- 8 puzzle----- and 
uncomment the section below # ----------15 size puszzle--------
